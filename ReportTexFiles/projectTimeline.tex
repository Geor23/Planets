\chapter{Project Planning}

%Discuss how the planning and time-management process worked during development. How closely did you keep to the plan? In what ways did it change - and why?

\section{Initial Goals Planned}

\section{In the beginning, there was nothing}
\markboth{\MakeUppercase{\thechapter. My Third Chapter }}{\thechapter}
Started out the project by familiarizing ourselves with the Unity Game Engine as well as the programming languages we had to use, C# and JavaScript.

\section{Initial Implementation}
\markboth{\MakeUppercase{\thechapter. My Third Chapter }}{\thechapter}
At first the game was just a single sphere running around a much larger sphere collecting spheres.

\section{Networking and Players}
\markboth{\MakeUppercase{\thechapter. My Third Chapter }}{\thechapter}
Expanding from a single player experience to a multiplayer one was one of the biggest challenges we had to face. The main obstacle being that once a resource has to be shared over the network, a lot of new variables have to be taken into consideration. We had to make sure that all the players received the same updates and are on the same pace.

\section{Planetarium and Testing}
\markboth{\MakeUppercase{\thechapter. My Third Chapter }}{\thechapter}
Porting the game to the planetarium was a very interesting experience. The way the Planetarium Dome works is that is got two projectors, each displaying the monitor contents of two individual servers, Master and Slave. The main challenge was scaling the the games interface and objects so that they are suitable for the Dome as well as make some texture changes to the objects so that when enabling 3D the different surfaces are still visible and looking good.
